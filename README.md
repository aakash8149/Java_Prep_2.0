## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the programs in this repository, ensure you have:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Version 8 or higher
  - Download from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use OpenJDK
- **IDE** (Optional but recommended)
  - IntelliJ IDEA
  - Eclipse
  - VS Code with Java Extension Pack
- **Command Line** knowledge for compilation and execution

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-programming.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd java-programming
```

3. Compile any Java file:
```bash
javac path/to/YourFile.java
```

4. Run the compiled program:
```bash
java path.to.YourFile
```

## 💻 How to Use

Each folder contains specific Java programs related to that topic. To run any program:

1. Navigate to the specific folder
2. Read the comments at the top of each file for program description
3. Compile the Java file using `javac`
4. Run the compiled class file using `java`

**Example:**

```bash
# Navigate to basics folder
cd basics

# Compile the program
javac HelloWorld.java

# Run the program
java HelloWorld
```

For projects with multiple files, refer to the individual README files within those directories.
